# dezoomcamp

Repository containing the assignment solutions and coursework for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) class.

The most interesting part is probably my [project](https://github.com/daniel-gheorghita/dezoomcamp/tree/main/7_project_Belgium_housing_market) regarding the Belgium housing market analysis.
